Villains have stolen the 3rd dimension, and it's YOUR job to travel through
action-packed puzzles to get the 3rd dimension back.

You move through the world using the WASD- or arrow keys. You can also pick up
blocks by moving the mouse pointer around the character and pressing the left
mouse button. This will pick up the block adjacent to the player in that
direction (if possible). Similarly you can place blocks with the
right mouse button. To cycle which block you want to place, use q and e.

The world of FlatCraft is built by 6 different elements, each with a distinct
colour.

- Dark grey: Metal
  - Indestructible blocks that cannot be picked up.
- Light grey: Rock
  - These blocks are similar to metal, except that they can be picked up, and
    also placed down other places by the player.
- Orange: Goal
  - Touch one of these blocks to win a level.
- Pink: Rubber
  - These blocks will allow you to jump much higher than usual. They can also
    be picked up and placed down other places by the player.
- Blue: Water
  - The player can swim in water. Water will also fall down due to gravity.
    Water-blocks can be picked up by the player and placed another place.
- Green: Acid
  - You don't want to touch these blocks! They act similarly to water, but
    if the player touches one of these blocks he dies instantly. Acid blocks
    can't be picked up either.
   
   
When starting the program from the command line, you can use the following
parameters to choose settings:

--sound true/false
	This enables or disables sound.
	
--fullscreen true/false
	This enables or disables fullscreen.
	
--bloom true/false
	This enables or disables bloom.
	
--particles true/false
	This enables or disables background particle effects.
	
--resolution res
	This changes the resolution. res can be one of:
	"WVGA"     -   800x480
	"QHD"      -   960x540
	"WSVGA"    -   1024x526
	"HD"       -   1280x720
	"HDPLUS"   -   1600x900
	"FULLHD"   -   1920x1080
	
	
Jiggling around with these settings can be a good idea if the game does not run
properly, or at all.

Good luck, and have fun ^^
