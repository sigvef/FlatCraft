Villains have stolen the 3rd dimension, and it's YOUR job to travel through
action-packed puzzles to get the 3rd dimension back.

You move through the world using the WASD- or arrow keys. You can also pick up
blocks by moving the mouse pointer around the character and pressing the left
mouse button. This will pick up the block adjacent to the player in that
direction (if possible). In the same manner you can place blocks with the
right mouse button. To cycle which block you want to place, use q and e.

The world of FlatCraft is built by 6 different elements, each with a distinct
colour.

- Dark grey: Metal
  - Indestructible blocks that cannot be picked up.
- Light grey: Rock
  - These blocks are similar to metal, except that they can be picked up, and
    also placed down other places by the player.
- Orange: Soil
  - Blocks that can be removed by the player, they are destroyed in the process
    however, so you cannot place them down other places.
- Pink: Rubber
  - These blocks will allow you to jump much higher than usual. They can also
    be picked up and placed down other places by the player.
- Blue: Water
  - The player can swim in water. Water will also fall down due to gravity.
    Water-blocks can be picked up by the player and placed another place.
- Green: Acid
  - You don't want to touch these blocks! They act similarly to water, but
    if the player touches one of these blocks he dies instantly. Acid blocks
    can't be picked up either.
